# Advertisement Click Prediction: Classification Model

## Overview
This project aims to build a classification model to predict whether a user will click on an advertisement based on features such as 'Daily Time Spent on Site', 'Age', 'Area Income', 'Daily Internet Usage', 'Ad Topic Line', 'City', 'Male', 'Country', and 'Timestamp'.

## Dataset
The dataset contains 10 columns including 'Clicked on Ad' as a target feature and 1000 records. Each record represents an individual user's behavior with regard to an online advertisement. 

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Methodology
1. **Data Loading**: Load the data and import the necessary libraries.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identify the structure of the data and the relationship between the features.

3. **Data Preprocessing**: Split the data into training and testing sets, scale numerical features, convert categorical features into one-hot vectors, and handle missing values if any.

4. **Modeling**: Implement a Logistic Regression model as a starting point, followed by K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest classifiers.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the performance of each model using accuracy and confusion matrix.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.

2. Install necessary packages mentioned in requirements.

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook.

## Results
Results will be evaluated based on the accuracy of the models and confusion matrix. This information will be printed on the console.

## Future Work
- Implement hyperparameter tuning for the KNN and Random Forest models to improve accuracy.
- Try more sophisticated models such as Gradient Boosting and Support Vector Machines.
- Investigate whether additional features could be useful.
