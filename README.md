# Top 50 Spotify Songs of 2019 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the "Top 50 Spotify Songs of 2019" dataset from Kaggle. The main goal of this project is to uncover trends and patterns in the data using visualization techniques with the help of Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be found on Kaggle: [Top 50 Spotify Songs of 2019](https://www.kaggle.com/leonardopena/top50spotify2019)

The dataset consists of the top 50 most-streamed songs on Spotify in 2019, with various features such as:

- Track name
- Artist name
- Genre
- Beats per minute (BPM)
- Energy
- Danceability
- Loudness
- Liveness
- Valence
- Length (duration)
- Acousticness
- Speechiness
- Popularity

## Project Overview

In this project, I have performed an in-depth EDA on the dataset to discover interesting insights and relationships between different features of the songs. The analysis includes:

1. Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and any inconsistencies in the data.
2. Descriptive Statistics: Analyzing summary statistics and distributions of different features.
3. Data Visualization: Creating visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries to understand the relationships between different features and uncover trends in the data.

## Notebooks

- `EDA_Top_50_Spotify_Songs_2019.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the detailed EDA, including data cleaning, descriptive statistics, and data visualization.

## Requirements

To run the Jupyter Notebook, you'll need to have the following Python libraries installed:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

You can install these libraries using `pip`:

```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook `EDA_Top_50_Spotify_Songs_2019.ipynb` and run the cells to explore the EDA.
