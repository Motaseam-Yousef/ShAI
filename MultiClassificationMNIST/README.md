# MNIST Classification Project

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on classifying the famous MNIST dataset. We use various techniques, starting from simple classifiers to more complex methods like Random Forests and K-Nearest Neighbors.

Ensure that you have the necessary packages installed. These include:

- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas

You can install them via pip:

```
$ pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn pandas
```

## Files

- `main.ipynb`: This is the main Jupyter notebook containing the code for data loading, model training, and evaluation.

## Running the Code

To run the code in the project, navigate to the project's directory and start jupyter notebook:

```
$ jupyter notebook
```

Then, open `main.ipynb` in the browser, and run the cells to see the code in action.

## Techniques Used

- Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier (SGDC)
- One-Versus-One (OvO) Strategy
- Random Forest Classifier
- Cross-Validation
- Error Analysis
- Multilabel Classification
- Multioutput Classification

## Results

The project includes several visualizations of the results, including:

- A display of MNIST digits
- A confusion matrix representation
- An image display of errors
